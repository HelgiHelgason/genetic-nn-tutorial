# genetic-nn-tutorial
Basic tutorial for training feed-forward neural networks with genetic algorithms

This code uses a genetic algorithm to train a feed forward neural network to learn to approximate the cos(x) function. It is intentionally written to be easily understandable, at the cost of it's size.
It has no dependencies except Numpy (and could easily be modified to not even require that).
Note that this is written and published only with education purposes in mind, real-world training of neural networks is generally much more efficient with backpropagation.
Genetic algorithms are worth understanding because, while being resource intensive, they make no requirements for end-to-end differentiability, can easily handle discrete variables and are easy to code.
